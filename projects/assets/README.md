Image assets for the portfolio

Place all portfolio images used by pages in this folder.

Required for the engine project (examples provided by assistant):
- `engine-actual.png`  — measured stock engine powercurve (replace with real image)
- `engine-model.png`   — model-extracted powercurve (replace with real image)

How to add images (PowerShell example):

mkdir -Force .\projects\assets
# Copy images into the folder (adjust source path)
copy C:\Users\<you>\Downloads\engine-actual.png .\projects\assets\engine-actual.png
copy C:\Users\<you>\Downloads\engine-model.png  .\projects\assets\engine-model.png

If you prefer, upload the images here and I can embed them directly into the repo for you.
